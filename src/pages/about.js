        <p>
          Fueled by my interests in political economy, tech, design and human
          interaction, I moved to Seattle 10 years ago and graduated from the
          University of Washington with a B.A. in Political Science. I then
          started working in the customer service industry and thatâ€™s when it
          really ignited my desire to get into user experience design.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          Growing up, I have always been passionate about visual design and code
          and then I grew up and became an adult. Now I want to focus on
          understanding how to create experiences that would help a customer
          (aka user) and help them get from point A to point B with the least
          amount of effort. I decided to enroll in the part-time UX design
          course at General Assembly and went on to complete a 3-month intensive
          coding bootcamp because I wanted to learn to make my vision come
          alive. Plus, who hasnâ€™t tried to fiddle with the HTML and CSS when
          they were on MySpace to make their page look the coolest of them all?
          I enjoy road trips and hiking and have recently started really
          exploring the backcountry a little bit more. I may or may not visit
          REI way too many times. When Iâ€™m not hustling at my 9-5 gig and side
          projects, you can find me enjoying a beer and possibly dancing
          awkwardly at a concert.{" "}
